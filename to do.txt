USE DEV BRANCH OR DONT PUSH AS MUCH TO NOT WASTE BUILDS

MAIN ISSUES:
- CONTENT
- add whale AI, lazarus and otter articles, and icon which works on iphone, and then add linktree to tiktok/insta bio
- reduce resolution/image size of high resolution post thumbnails (e.g. packing, suncream)
- make post spacing consistent: eitehr add extra spacing before titles in packing article, or remove from toher articles
    (might actually look better more compact without extra spacing - ask other people)
- add method for adding more images to posts, with text to the side (and add to existing posts)
- replace amazon links with affiliate links - then with onelinks
- update word docs to refelct changes made to markdown (e.g. suncream swapped for suncream in suncream article, tweaks and title change to fungus article)
- linktree on insta/facebook/tiktok
- add overlay to images like spotify to make writing legible
- add manifest
- switch to svg icons
- add apple mask icons
- check consent/disclaimer rules - add privacy policy page in footer
    - User Data Collection Acknowledgement in GA4 = put in team gpt and check im ok

- hide UTM parameters
    - code to clean URL - alters web history and could impact seo - possibel to do without altering web history?
    - replace UTM with fragments and a GTM lookup table - works with GA4? - would it refire on other pages?
- make postts more interesting - add inline images and diagrams
- amke sure page views can track which index pages are being visited - currently registers all as wild atlas


CREATE MANIFEST.JSON
- apparently mandatory for lighthouse test


DOWNLOAD FONTS AS BACKUP

ICON
- Switch to svg icon?
    -higher res, more modern, can change colour with css (e.g. for a dark mode)
- apple mask icon
- ico backup not working

add a dark mode? - wrong aesthetic really



- scrap blog section, and just have destinaitons page wher every articles are all jst places?

TIKTOK
4. Make 3 travel-based tiktok drafts
5. Update tiktok profile pic and bio with linktree
6. Follow everyone I'm confident would follwo back on tiktok- message people if needed
7. post first tiktok - make first one niche/funny a not basic - chloe could unfollow, it's mostly to friends (photos the make me say cant believe id id that one maybe?)
    -but also don't want to waste a high potential tiktok which could draw lots of followers by psoting when there's no other content on page
    -wait three hours and post second?
8. wait 1-2 days - post second tiktok about festival scam
9. request to follow laods of people tha tI know less well and jsut see generally and post second tiktok
10. wait 1-2 days and psot third tiktok
11. start posting 1-2 times a week
12. start series with posts falling into categories with simialr formats, spaced out with occassional random/funny content
    - wtf is/are xxxx: explain terms and things, empahsis on anmials/nature
    - DONT USE WTF - SWEARING COULD BOMB VIDOES/ACCOUNT
        - conjugate (gym)
        - creatine
        - weird animal (axolotls, or only more niche things? make axolotls et.c jst normal wildife videos?)
    - wildlife
        - otters
        - axolotls
        - jelly fish
        - alpacas
        - whales (fads, language, paper with 15 min conversation saying hi etc.)
BANNED WORDS
- swearing/swearing abbreviations (wtf)
    - spoken or in text
- pseudo swear words? (what the hell, bloody etc.)
    - other videos mention hell (gay devil etc.)
- mention of alcohol or drugs
- blood/violence/bombs
- sex, suck, dick etc.

INSTA
1. put linktree in bio without website
2. Post on insta more
    - dumps
    - posts fromm while ago (e.g. taormina)
    - non-time-specific posts (e.g. sunsets, sky, refelctions)
2. use insta to promote tiktok and website
3. add website to linktree

TIKTOK SHOP
- use to sell prints
- start dropshipping




HOMEPAGE
- add profits go to eco charities in about footer
- add eco hosting in normal footer or about footer once switched

BLOG
- navigation links glitch slightly when the page is loaded/refreshed, 
appearing right of where they should be before moving to their correct position
- remove status property from all posts and just infer from published_at/delted_at being null or having dates
- switch back to masonry layout? 

REVIEWS/ARTICLES
- instead of masonry layout, use verticle scrolling list, with lines that extend 
partially across the screen (starting closer to the left and ending about 3/3 across the page) separating each post,
an image on the far lef of each post section, text in bold for the title and then a description in slightly grey text
- OR use normal grid with square images like wild atlas but not rounded, with centred text that fades to description
- star ratings? add in metadataso they can be used as filters?
- rename articels to science/nature?
- use same posts colelction for articles and travel tips, and travel tips just filters fro ones based on travel (e.g. with travel tag?)

Add colour for current page with slight fade transitions
Turn menu icon into x while open
Try solid white navigation page without rounded corners like along dusty roads
Add slide in/out animation for menu - fast like along dusty roads

POST layouts
- add drop shadows to images


POSTS
- update code to handle invalid dates (particularly published_at)
    - handle where date is null, just not the 'null' string



ORDERING
- put CSS in head so it loads before content
- ask chatgpt about ordering of otehr thing to make sure there isn't an instant with things out of position - move styles further up?

GRID LAYOUT
- create text grid layout, with title and descruption underneath each image
- experiment with slightly wider aspect images (like articles page)
- add ellipses if description overflows

MASONRY LAYOUT
- fix to order across before ordering by column
- upcoming inbuit support for masonry grid but not supported by browsers yet

ANALYTICS

ADD TITLE IN HOMEPAGE FONT TO EVERY PAGE

MOVE FONT LINK IMPORTS AND OTHER GLOBAL STUFF TO BaseHead.astro


FOOTER
- add sign up field
- add work with us, contact, disclaimer and environmentalism/ethics of travelling page links

ADD 404 pages

HOSTING
Favourites:
- Cloudflare pages
- Firebase
- Render

- Heroku
- Github pages
- Appliku
- Webhosting UK?
- Krystal - eco hosting
- does cloudflare have hosting?

want free tier but reasonable progression once paid - heroku might have big jump, appliku or render seem better, not sure about github and Firebase



TECH website- duplicate site, but with home page just for rounded squares with text at the top and an icon in the middle, each for a different serves, with an almost cartoony modern art style




UNSTYLED LAYOUT:
- add max width to math other post layouts?
- use metadata to create title and date without displaying if possible
- 

import PostLayoutUnstyled from '../layouts/PostLayoutUnstyled.astro';

// You could fetch and use the content from a Markdown file here.
// For simplicity, let's say you've pasted the content directly.
const markdownContent = `
# My Blog Post

![Image Alt Text](/path/to/image.jpg)

Some text here...
`;
