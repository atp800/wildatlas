HOMEPAGE
- navigation bar is briefly visible when page is loaded and refreshed - website seems to be defaulting to displaying the menu, 
doing a window-size check or soemthing and then closing it. COuld be fixed by switching file to svelte for speed 
(could aslo be done with Nav.astro component) or by changing implementation


BLOG
- navigation links glitch slightly when the page is loaded/refreshed, 
appearing right of where they should be before moving to their correct position


REVIEWS/ARTICLES
- instead of masonry layout, use verticle scrolling list, with lines that extend 
partially across the screen (starting closer to the left and ending about 3/3 across the page) separating each post,
an image on the far lef of each post section, text in bold for the title and then a description in slightly grey text
- OR use normal grid with square images like wild atlas but not rounded, with centred text that fades to description
- star ratings? add in metadataso they can be used as filters?

Add colour for current page wuth slight fade transitions
Turn menu icon into x while open
Try solid white navigation page without rounded corners like along dusty roads
Add slide in/out animation for menu - fast like along dusty roads


ANALYTICS


MONETISATION
https://www.alongdustyroads.com/work-with-us/
avoid ads? - stick to affiliate links, sponsorships, colabs and services?


HOSTING
- Heroku
- Github pages
- Firebase
- Appliku
- Render
- does cloudflare have hosting?

want free tier but reasonable progression once paid - heroku might have big jump, appliku or render seem better, not sure about github and Firebase



TECH website- duplicate site, but with home page just for rounded squares with text at the top and an icon in the middle, each for a different serves, with an almost cartoony modern art style
