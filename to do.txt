HOMEPAGE
- navigation bar is briefly visible when page is loaded and refreshed - website seems to be defaulting to displaying the menu, 
doing a window-size check or soemthing and then closing it. COuld be fixed by switching file to svelte for speed 
(could aslo be done with Nav.astro component) or by changing implementation


BLOG
- navigation links glitch slightly when the page is loaded/refreshed, 
appearing right of where they should be before moving to their correct position
- remove status property from all posts and just infer from published_at/delted_at being null or having dates
- switch back to masonry layout? 

REVIEWS/ARTICLES
- instead of masonry layout, use verticle scrolling list, with lines that extend 
partially across the screen (starting closer to the left and ending about 3/3 across the page) separating each post,
an image on the far lef of each post section, text in bold for the title and then a description in slightly grey text
- OR use normal grid with square images like wild atlas but not rounded, with centred text that fades to description
- star ratings? add in metadataso they can be used as filters?
- rename articels to science/nature?
- use same posts colelction for articles and travel tips, and travel tips just filters fro ones based on travel (e.g. with travel tag?)

Add colour for current page with slight fade transitions
Turn menu icon into x while open
Try solid white navigation page without rounded corners like along dusty roads
Add slide in/out animation for menu - fast like along dusty roads


ORDERING
- put CSS in head so it loads before content
- ask chatgpt about ordering of otehr thing to make sure there isn't an instant with things out of position - move styles further up?


MASONRY LAYOUT
- fix to order across before ordering by column
- upcoming inbuit support for masonry grid but not supported by browsers yet

TECH website- duplicate site, but with home page just for rounded squares with text at the top and an icon in the middle, each for a different serves, with an almost cartoony modern art style
