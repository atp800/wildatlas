# Performance Optimizations Applied

This document outlines all the performance optimizations applied to fix the Google Lighthouse issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Exclude Display Blocking Resources (1,760ms savings)
**Problem**: Google Fonts were blocking page rendering
**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Added `preconnect` to Google Fonts domains in BaseHead.astro
- ✅ Implemented asynchronous font loading using `preload` with `onload` fallback
- ✅ Added `noscript` fallback for users with JavaScript disabled
- ✅ Added critical CSS inlining for above-the-fold content

### 2. Reducing Impact of Third-Party Code (280ms blocking)
**Problem**: Google Tag Manager was blocking the main thread
**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Deferred GTM loading until after page load using `window.addEventListener('load')`
- ✅ This prevents GTM from blocking initial page rendering

### 3. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - 2,560ms
**Problem**: Large images and render-blocking resources causing slow LCP
**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Preloaded critical images (homepage hero image and logo)
- ✅ Converted images to WebP format for better compression
- ✅ Added critical CSS for hero section to prevent layout shifts
- ✅ Optimized font loading to reduce render blocking

### 4. Image Elements Missing Width/Height
**Problem**: Images without dimensions causing layout shifts (CLS)
**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Added explicit `width` and `height` attributes to all images
- ✅ Created OptimizedImage component with proper dimensions
- ✅ Updated logo and hero images with proper sizing

### 5. Next-Generation Image Formats (1,242 KB savings)
**Problem**: Using JPEG/PNG instead of modern formats
**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Created OptimizedImage component with WebP support
- ✅ Implemented `<picture>` element with WebP and fallback sources
- ✅ Updated homepage to use WebP images with JPEG fallbacks
- ✅ Created image optimization script for batch processing

### 6. Properly Sized Images (939 KB savings)
**Problem**: Serving oversized images for mobile devices
**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Created responsive image system with multiple sizes
- ✅ Implemented `srcset` with different image widths (320w, 640w, 768w, 1024w, 1280w)
- ✅ Added proper `sizes` attribute for responsive loading
- ✅ Created Sharp-based image optimization script

### 7. Unused JavaScript (104 KB savings)
**Problem**: Google Tag Manager loading unused code upfront
**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Deferred GTM loading until after page load
- ✅ This reduces initial JavaScript bundle size

### 8. Long Main Task Chain
**Problem**: GTM causing long-running tasks
**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Deferred GTM execution to prevent blocking main thread
- ✅ Improved overall JavaScript execution timing

### 9. Layout Shifts (CLS)
**Problem**: Font loading and missing image dimensions causing shifts
**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Added critical CSS for immediate font rendering
- ✅ Added explicit image dimensions
- ✅ Implemented `font-display: swap` in Google Fonts loading

### 10. Critical Request Chains
**Problem**: Multiple dependent resource requests
**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Preloaded critical resources (fonts, images)
- ✅ Optimized resource loading order
- ✅ Reduced dependency chains through better resource prioritization

## New Components Created

### OptimizedImage.astro
- Automatically generates WebP versions with JPEG fallbacks
- Implements responsive images with srcset
- Includes proper loading attributes and dimensions
- Supports lazy loading for non-critical images

### Image Optimization Script
- `scripts/optimize-images.js` - Batch processes all images
- Generates WebP versions and multiple sizes
- Uses Sharp for high-quality image processing
- Can be run with `npm run optimize-images`

## Performance Scripts Added

```json
{
  "optimize-images": "node scripts/optimize-images.js",
  "build:optimized": "npm run optimize-images && astro build"
}
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

Based on Lighthouse recommendations:
- **1,760ms** saved from optimized font loading
- **1,242 KB** saved from WebP image formats
- **939 KB** saved from properly sized images
- **280ms** reduced main thread blocking
- **104 KB** reduced unused JavaScript
- Improved **LCP** from 2,560ms through multiple optimizations
- Reduced **CLS** through proper image dimensions and critical CSS

## Usage Instructions

### For Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### For Optimized Production Build
```bash
npm run build:optimized
```

### To Optimize Images Only
```bash
npm run optimize-images
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Font Loading Strategy
- Preconnect to Google Fonts domains
- Asynchronous loading with JavaScript fallback
- Critical CSS inlined for immediate rendering
- Proper fallback fonts specified

### Image Loading Strategy
- WebP format with JPEG fallbacks
- Responsive images with srcset
- Proper lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Explicit dimensions to prevent layout shifts

### Third-Party Script Strategy
- Deferred loading until after page load
- Non-blocking implementation
- Maintained functionality while improving performance

## Browser Support
- WebP images with automatic fallbacks for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Graceful degradation for JavaScript-disabled users

## Monitoring
After implementing these changes, monitor your Lighthouse scores to verify improvements:
- Performance score should increase significantly
- LCP should be under 2.5s
- CLS should be under 0.1
- FCP should improve due to reduced render blocking
